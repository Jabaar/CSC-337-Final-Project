McClain had been stopped and put into a neck hold by police that left him weakened when the paramedics arrived and injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine. Initially, no one was charged because the cause of McClain's death couldn't be determined. However, a renewed focus on the case prompted an indictment against the paramedics and three officers.", "summary": "The final trial over the death of Elijah McClain is expected to set a precedent for holding paramedics accountable in similar cases. Paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Lt. Peter Cichuniec are facing charges of manslaughter, negligent homicide, and assault for administering a lethal dose of ketamine after McClain was restrained by police. This trial could have broader implications for the prosecution of medical first responders in the future. The case highlights the changing perceptions of law enforcement and medical care in the aftermath of high-profile cases like George Floyd's murder."}, "urls": ["https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-paramedics-face-homicide-charges-death-elijah-mcclain", "http://thegrio.com/2023/11/27/final-trial-over-elijah-mcclains-death-shines-light-on-paramedics-role/", "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/final-trial-elijah-mcclains-death-suburban-denver-spotlights-105173051", "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/final-trial-elijah-mcclains-death-suburban-denver-spotlights-105173049"], "topics": ["politics", "health"]}, {"title": "Bangladesh Arrests Thousands in 'Violent' Crackdown: HRW", "content": {"background": "Bangladesh has launched a sweeping and violent crackdown on opposition parties ahead of general elections, including arresting almost 10,000 activists.
