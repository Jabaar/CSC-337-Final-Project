This law had reduced the flow of West Africans to Europe but negatively impacted desert communities' economies. The junta is seeking support from these communities and reassessing its relations with former western allies. The number of migrants moving through Niger had dropped due to the law, causing unemployment and economic decline in towns and villages. The European Union had launched a trust fund to address migration, but many felt it was insufficient. The impact on migration to Europe and how European leaders will respond to this repeal are yet to be seen.

It is one of the most substantial exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the military from being used for law enforcement.

The Insurrection Act would grant him significant authority to deploy the military for domestic policing, bypassing court review. However, military leaders, such as Gen. Charles Q.
