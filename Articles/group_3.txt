Title: Impact of Overturning Roe v. Wade on US Births

Background: The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has led to significant changes in abortion access and subsequent birth rates in the United States. This landmark decision returned the issue of abortion to individual states, allowing them to enact restrictions or bans on the procedure.

Summary: A study conducted by the Institute of Labor Economics reveals that approximately 32,000 additional babies were born in the first six months of 2023 in states that enforced total abortion bans, compared to states where abortion rights remained protected. The study highlights the "most profound transformation of the landscape of US abortion access in 50 years." As of November 2023, 14 states have implemented abortion bans in almost all circumstances, leading to increased travel distances for women seeking the procedure. Supporters of the abortion restrictions argue that it reflects the success of pro-life policies. Critics, however, view these findings as an assault on reproductive autonomy, with potential risks to the health and financial stability of vulnerable populations.
