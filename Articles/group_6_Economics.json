        "title": "The Transformation of the American Economy",
        "background": "Over the past half century, the American economy has undergone a significant transformation. The chances of achieving the American dream have declined, with only 50% of Americans born in 1980 earning more than their parents, compared to 92% of those born in 1940. This shift can be attributed to the abandonment of the New Deal era policies that promoted strong unions, high taxes, public investments, and social safety nets. Instead, the United States pivoted to free-market economics under Ronald Reagan, leading to increased inequality and stagnant living standards. There are three main theories to explain this shift: backlash to civil rights legislation, the cultural elitism of the Democratic Party, and global crises beyond political control. These theories, while incomplete on their own, help make sense of the political and economic uncertainties in America today.",
