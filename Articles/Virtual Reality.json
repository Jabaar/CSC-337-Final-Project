            "background": "The Supreme Court has agreed to hear five cases that reexamine content moderation rules on social media platforms and the government's limitations on affecting speech on these platforms. The cases address issues such as whether elected officials can block constituents on their social media accounts, and whether state laws that regulate social media platforms' content moderation practices violate their First Amendment rights.",
            "summary": "The Supreme Court will review cases related to content moderation on social media platforms, including the blocking of constituents by elected officials and state laws that regulate content moderation. The court's decisions could impact the definition of public forums in the digital space, the ability of government officials to block users, and the freedom of social media platforms to make editorial choices. The cases also address government efforts to influence content moderation policies and the potential infringement on free speech."

            "background": "Mixed reality combines virtual and physical elements to create immersive experiences. Presence, or the feeling of being present in a mixed reality environment, is an important factor in user engagement. Traditionally, presence is measured through subjective questionnaires, but researchers at UMass Amherst have identified reaction time as a potential real-time measurement tool. By studying participants' reaction times to different virtual stimuli, they found that slower reaction times indicate low presence, while faster reaction times indicate high presence. This finding has implications for improving the calibration of mixed reality experiences and optimizing user engagement.",
