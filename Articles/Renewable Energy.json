Many argue that having oil and gas producers at the helm of climate talks poses a conflict of interest. UAE's oil and gas industry plans to increase oil production and has been accused of flaring more gas than reported. The country's hydrocarbon sector makes up a significant portion of its economy and government revenues.", "summary": "The UAE has a high dependency on oil consumption, despite efforts to diversify its economy. Adnoc and other international oil companies are investing in select technologies to reduce emissions, but these measures will have a limited impact. The UAE has ratified the Paris climate agreement and commits to net zero emissions by 2050. It ranks high in solar power capacity and has a nuclear power plant. The country needs to transition to a knowledge-based economy to provide sufficient jobs. Rising temperatures pose risks to its tourism sector. One major oil-exporting country must announce plans to leave some oil untapped, and COP28 provides an opportunity for such a commitment. The UAE has the resources to build a post-oil economy but may hesitate to be the first mover."}, "urls": ["https://www.juancole.com/2023/11/emirates-hosting-climate.html", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cop28-inside-the-united-arab-emirates-the-oil-giant-hosting-2023-climate-change-summit/articleshow/105549534.cms"], "topics": ["economics", "technology", "politics", "world"]}, {"title": "COP28 Climate Talks: What to Expect and What It Means for Our Energy Future", "content": {"background": "The UN's COP28 climate conference in Dubai brings together countries to assess progress in dealing with climate change and work on reducing global warming.
