However, these warnings are based on a misunderstanding of how the feature actually works.", "summary": "Police departments have been sharing warnings on social media about the NameDrop feature, claiming that it can easily collect children's contact information. However, this is not accurate as the feature requires deliberate action from users to share their contact info, and it only works when devices are held very close together for a few seconds. These warnings seem to have been sparked by a misrepresentation of the feature in a TikTok video. Apple needs to improve its communication of new features in software updates to ensure users understand them."}, "urls": ["https://www.macworld.com/article/2155780/local-police-departments-namedrop-warning-parents.html", "https://www.macworld.com/article/2155780/namedrop-warning-disable-kids-local-police.html"], "topics": ["technology"]}, {"title": "Software Updates", "content": {"background": "This collection of articles from ZDNET provides recommendations on various tech products and services, including discounts on software and devices.", "summary": "ZDNET's recommendations are based on thorough testing, research, and comparison shopping.
