[{"title": "Doctors warn of New Zealand health tragedy after smoking ban scrapped", "content": {"background": "New Zealand's conservative government has revoked world-leading anti-smoking laws, leading to concerns from doctors about the negative impact on public health. The country had previously implemented a suite of anti-smoking measures under former prime minister Jacinda Ardern, establishing itself as a global leader in the fight against Big Tobacco. However, the new premier, Christopher Luxon, has scrapped these laws, prompting criticism from public health experts.", "summary": "The revocation of New Zealand's anti-smoking laws by the conservative government has been heavily criticized by doctors and public health experts. The country's reputation as a leader in the global fight against Big Tobacco has been tarnished, and there are concerns about the negative impact on public health. Previously planned measures, such as a generational smoking ban and the reduction of nicotine levels in cigarettes, were highly innovative and would have had a profound effect on reducing smoking. Countries that were inspired by New Zealand's efforts are now disappointed by this decision. New Zealand's Indigenous Maori population, which is disproportionately affected by tobacco-related diseases, will suffer the consequences of this policy change. Experts are puzzled by the government's change of heart, as smoking was not a prominent issue in the recent general election campaign. Some speculate that the government was motivated by potential tax revenue from cigarette sales, but critics argue that this reasoning is flawed. Overall, this decision is viewed as a disastrous and terrible move with global implications."}, "urls": ["https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/doctors-warn-of-new-zealand-health-tragedy-after-smoking-ban-scrapped/article", "https://www.ibtimes.com/doctors-warn-new-zealand-health-tragedy-after-smoking-ban-scrapped-3719555"], "topics": ["health", "politics"]}, {"title": "Australia to ban single-use vape imports from 2024", "content": {"background": "Australia is cracking down on the import of single-use vapes and planning to ban their manufacture, advertising, and supply. This move is in response to the concerning increase in vaping among young people, which has become a recreational product targeted at children.

The government also plans to outlaw the manufacture, advertising, and supply of disposable vapes. About one in seven children aged 14-17 in Australia uses vapes, and there is a concerning link between vaping and increased tobacco smoking. The Australian Medical Association supports the government's action, as Australia has been a leader in reducing smoking rates and protecting public health. Despite the ban, doctors and nurses will be able to prescribe vapes in certain cases. This measure comes after Australia's success in implementing plain packaging laws for cigarettes. The neighboring country, New Zealand, had previously joined Australia in fighting smoking but recently decided to cancel a generational smoking ban. Vaping is seen as a dangerous gateway to tobacco smoking for some individuals and may impact population health in the future."}, "urls": ["https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/australia-to-ban-single-use-vape-imports-from-2024", "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/children-are-addicted-australia-to-ban-disposable-vapes-imports-4612727", "https://www.news24.com/news24/world/news/up-in-smoke-australia-to-ban-disposable-vape-imports-from-1-january-20231128"], "topics": ["health", "politics"]}, {"title": "SC refuses to entertain DMK minister Senthil Balaji's plea seeking bail on health grounds", "content": {"background": "DMK minister Senthil Balaji sought bail on health grounds after being arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.
