        "title": "Elon Musk's X may lose up to $75 million in ad revenue: Report",
        "background": "Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is facing a significant revenue loss due to an advertiser exodus. Major brands, including Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery, have paused their advertising campaigns on X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post. Additionally, a report by Media Matters alleged that ads for brands like Apple and Oracle appeared beside posts promoting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. Internal documents reveal that more than 200 companies, including Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft, have either halted or are considering pausing their ads on the platform. X has stated that $11 million in revenue is at risk, but the exact figure fluctuates as advertisers return or increase spending. The platform's ad revenue has declined significantly since Musk's takeover in October 2022.",
        "summary": "Elon Musk's social media platform X is facing a potential loss of up to $75 million in advertising revenue. The exodus of major brands follows Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic post, as well as a report that exposed ads appearing next to pro-Nazi content. Internal documents indicate that more than 200 companies, including major players like Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Microsoft, have paused or are considering pausing their ads on X. While X claims that $11 million is at risk, the exact figure varies based on advertiser behavior. Musk's ownership has resulted in a decline in content moderation, causing civil rights groups to report a rise in hate speech on the platform."
