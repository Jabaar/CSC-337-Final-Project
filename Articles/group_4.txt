Title: The Transformation of the American Economy: From Prosperity to Uncertainty
Background: Over the past five decades, the American economy has undergone a significant transformation. The chances of achieving the American dream, where individuals earn more than their parents, have declined sharply. This shift can be attributed to the abandonment of the postwar consensus and the implementation of free-market economics. The reasons behind this shift can be attributed to the backlash against civil rights legislation, the cultural elitism of the Democratic Party, and global economic crises. These factors have contributed to the rise of Donald Trump and the populist sentiments that currently exist in American society.

Summary: This article examines the reasons behind the abandonment of the postwar consensus in the United States and the rise of free-market economics. It explores three main theories: the white backlash to civil rights legislation, the Democratic Party's cultural elitism, and the role of global economic crises. The article argues that these factors, along with the changing economic circumstances of the 1970s, led to the implementation of free-market policies by Ronald Reagan. The current political and economic uncertainty in the United States calls for a new economic consensus, but the path forward remains unclear.
