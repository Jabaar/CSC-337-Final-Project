        "summary": "The Liberian-flagged tanker Central Park, managed by Zodiac Maritime, was seized by armed assailants in the Gulf of Aden. The attackers later surrendered following pursuit by the USS Mason. Two ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled Yemen landed near the warship. The vessel was later released, and its crew of 22 sailors from multiple nationalities were unharmed. Yemen's internationally recognized government blamed the Houthi rebels for the attack. This incident is part of a series of ship attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war, with global shipping increasingly targeted during the conflict. Previous attacks on Israel-linked tankers include the Mercer Street off the coast of Oman.",
