Title: US States Recycle and Donate Food Headed to Landfills

Background: With concerns over food waste taking up landfill space and contributing to global warming, a growing number of US states are implementing initiatives to rescue and donate unwanted food. Currently, the US wastes 40% of its food, amounting to $218 billion in annual production costs and 57 metric tons of waste. The goal is to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030 by increasing awareness and implementing state-led initiatives.

Summary: Several states, including New York, California, and Vermont, have established programs to redirect edible food to food pantries, compost, or energy conversion. All states have passed legislation to protect donors and recovery organizations from liability. The success of these initiatives is evident in New York, where donations have already equated to over 4 million meals. However, there is a need for a coordinated national effort to ensure the 2030 goal is met, and a shift towards not producing excess food in the first place would provide the best solution to food waste.
