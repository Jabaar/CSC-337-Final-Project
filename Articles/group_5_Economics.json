        "title": "Impact of Overturned Roe v. Wade on US Births",
        "background": "In June 2022, the US Supreme Court reversed the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, allowing individual states to restrict or ban abortions. A recent study examined the effects of this decision and found that approximately 32,000 additional babies have been born in states with abortion restrictions. The study also highlighted that 23% of US women of reproductive age now have to travel longer distances to access abortion services, posing challenges to their reproductive autonomy. The implications of these changes are of concern for the health and financial stability of low-income individuals.",
