Title: Presidents and Thanksgiving: A History of Economic Recovery and Gratitude
Background: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt all played key roles in establishing Thanksgiving as a national holiday in the United States. Each president faced a major financial crisis related to war and utilized strategies such as sovereign money and credit to bring the country through those difficult times. Despite the challenges faced by the country today, it is important to remember the successes of the past and the potential for future economic growth and stability.
Summary: George Washington struggled to secure funding for the American colonies' fight for independence from Britain, but he established the first federal Thanksgiving holiday as a way to give thanks for bringing the country through that major financial crisis. Abraham Lincoln faced a similar challenge during the Civil War and used the national banking system and government-issued currency to finance the war effort while also initiating infrastructure projects to stimulate economic development. Franklin Roosevelt, leading the country through the Great Depression and World War II, used the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to fund New Deal programs and stimulate economic recovery. In light of the current economic challenges, it is suggested that a National Infrastructure Bank could be established to generate low-cost credit for development and help create a thriving economy to be thankful for.
