        "background": "A growing number of US states, including New York, are implementing initiatives to reduce food waste by requiring businesses to donate edible food and recycle food scraps. This is motivated by concerns over diminishing landfill space and the greenhouse gas emissions released when food decomposes in landfills. Globally, a third of food is wasted, and in the US, it's even higher at 40%. The US spends approximately $218 billion annually on wasted food production. The US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have set a goal of 50% food waste reduction by 2030, and several state-led efforts are underway to achieve this goal.",
