        "title": "White House grapples with internal divisions on Israel-Gaza",
        "background": "The White House is wrestling with internal divisions over the Israel-Gaza conflict, which has become the biggest foreign policy challenge of President Joe Biden's tenure so far. Staffers are divided over the administration's response to the crisis and concerns have been raised about its impact on America's global standing. While the administration has been careful not to publicly criticize Israel, it has privately urged the country to minimize civilian casualties and allow aid into Gaza. However, Biden's personal attachment to Israel has complicated the issue, and aides fear that US efforts to influence Israeli tactics may be limited.",
        "summary": "The Israel-Gaza conflict has divided the White House, with concerns raised over the administration's handling of civilian casualties and aid in Gaza. Biden's personal attachment to Israel has complicated the situation, as has the political cost of breaking with the country. The administration has been careful not to publicly criticize Israel, but has privately urged it to minimize civilian casualties. Some officials worry that Israel will not show restraint as it moves the operation to the south of Gaza, while others fear that the longer the conflict continues, the more harm it will cause Biden politically and diplomatically.",
