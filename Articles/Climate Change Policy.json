[{"title": "Climate Change Policy", "content": {"background": "The United Nations is hosting COP28, the annual climate conference, in Dubai. The conference aims to address the lack of progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, requires countries to pledge emissions reductions and review their progress. The global stocktake will assess this progress and provide a report on the efforts to meet the agreement's goals. Key topics of discussion include a phase-down of fossil fuels, climate finance for developing countries, health impacts of climate change, and nature-based solutions.", "summary": "The biggest challenges at COP28 include the lack of progress in reducing emissions, particularly around the phase-down of fossil fuels. The global stocktake will highlight the urgency of the situation and the need for action. Climate finance for developing countries is a contentious issue, with calls for increased funding to address adaptation and mitigation efforts. The health impacts of climate change will be a focus, as extreme weather events worsen public health. Nature-based solutions, such as protecting forests and promoting biodiversity, will be emphasized as a means of carbon sequestration. Overall, the conference aims to address these key issues and strengthen international collaboration on climate change."}, "urls": ["https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2023/11/28/climate-change/cop28-climate-chaos-record-heat/", "https://www.voanews.com/a/cop28-has-big-agenda-but-won-t-have-biden-xi/7372863.html", "https://www.kqed.org/science/1985560/faq-annual-climate-negotiations-are-about-to-start-do-they-matter", "https://www.newsweek.com/five-things-people-watch-un-cop28-climate-talks-1847077"], "topics": ["economics", "technology", "health", "world"]}]
