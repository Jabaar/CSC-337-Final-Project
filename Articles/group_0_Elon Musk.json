        "background": "Some X users are potentially earning money by spreading misinformation on the platform. NewsGuard, a misinformation watchdog organization, discovered that ads from major advertisers appeared on viral posts containing false or misleading claims about the Israel-Hamas war. These posts were viewed by millions of X users. Despite claims that flagged posts would not be eligible for ad revenue, NewsGuard found that ads from numerous organizations appeared on tweets spreading war-related misinformation without fact-checks. This raises concerns that both advertisers and misinformation spreaders could be profiting from X's ad-revenue sharing program. The uncovering of this issue comes after a report revealed that X ads were displayed alongside pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic posts, leading to advertisers pulling out and prompting Elon Musk to sue the reporting organization. The loss of advertisers could result in a potential revenue loss of $75 million for X.",
