        "title": "Concern rises among Europeâ€™s Jewish communities as antisemitism increases",
        "background": "The recent Israel-Hamas conflict has led to a surge in antisemitism in Europe, causing concern among Jewish communities. The conflict resulted in the biggest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, and the fallout has extended to Europe where deadly anti-Jewish hatred has long existed. Rising antisemitism in Europe is particularly fearsome for those who are only a few generations removed from the victims of historical anti-Semitic events. Many Jews are disturbed by the lack of empathy for Israeli victims and their families. Antisemitism is broadly defined as hatred of Jews, but there is ongoing debate about what actions and words should be considered antisemitic. Criticism of Israel's policies is often conflated with antisemitism, which undermines opposition to Israeli policies. The recent conflict has led to a significant increase in antisemitic incidents in countries such as France, Denmark, and the UK, despite widespread denunciations of anti-Jewish hatred by European leaders. Jewish school children have experienced bullying and discrimination, resulting in discussions about hiding visible signs of Jewish identity. In several European countries, antisemitic incidents and attacks have been reported, including firebombings and stabbings. Some Jewish community members are changing their behavior and considering moving to Israel for safety. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations have also featured chants that some Jews consider antisemitic and perceive as calling for the destruction of Israel. In response to the rising antisemitism, actions such as setting up hotlines for support and distributing resources on addressing antisemitism in schools have been taken by Jewish communities.",
